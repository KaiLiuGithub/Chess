App for different versions of chess

This app for Android contains 3 different international versions of chess (Western Chess, Chinese Chess, and Japanese Chess).

A companion server project will allow you to create accounts and store the game data remotely (https://github.com/KaiLiuGithub/ChessAppServer)
